- Run `npm run build` to ensure TypeScript compiles to dist without errors.
- If tool behavior changed, update README and `_docs` notes plus mention new/changed MCP tools.
- Verify key flows locally (e.g., `npm run dev` + `mcp call run_review {...}` or at least dry-run ensure_cli) and capture any missing logs/resources.
- Summarize remaining risks or TODOs in `_docs/issue.md` before handing back to the user.
